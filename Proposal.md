### What goal will your website be designed to achieve?

An application based off a subject for learning more.  Wether it be education, sports, traveling, etc., many fields and subjects require a way for large quantities of information to be extracted and presented in a helpful manner.

Users will have access to a wide variety of metadata pertaining to information and characters within Star Trek in a wiki-styled website that will also have forums for user engagement.

Creating a website based off of information in the database to demonstrate a fullstack skillset.  Using existing information available through the Star Trek API also known as STAPI,  I aim to use familiar topics such as characters, shows and movies for a user to learn more information and see metadata and lore within the for more trivia and statistics.  Designed using the LCARS based interface it allows a users to search within a prepopulated User Interface to gain more knowledge and information about Star Trek.

This website is designed in the mindset of bringing a multitude of data into a friendly UI experience.

### What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?

This website is for fans and those who wish to learn more about the Star Trek Universe.  Despite it's long history, content and website pertaining to the Star Trek are limited.  The website is for anyone who wishes to see and learn more about Star Trek.

### What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain?

1. The STAPI as a seed for information that will help with the options and relationships of characters, shows and movies to one another.
2. The OMDB for movie information.
3. The TVDB for series information.
